# Darts Pro

Darts Pro is a darts score counter.
It was hard to find a good darts score counter for iOS, so i decided to make my own.

## Working Progress

Made possible to manage players and store them as well.

Made possible to select players for the actual game, and store them as well for the upcoming match too.

It is possible now to load the first 1 vs 1 game, it still nedds a little polishing, but I am on it.
And you can't win now, it's just counting the score.

Now you can Win!
If you do so you get an alert what takes you back one view, where you can start another game.

Added some hints why you cant press enter when you want to submit more than 180 ponts, and an alert for hitting the enter if you did not score at all.
